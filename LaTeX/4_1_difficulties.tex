\subsubsection*{Difficulties and Strategies}
We could not find out, which Python and Scikit-Learn version was used. We simply used recent versions of both, because guessing, which versions the researchers had on their computers seemed hopeless to us, since they probably did not have the most recent versions installed. This problem is also crucial, because they used the default parameters of the Machine Learning models, which probably changed over the years. 

Again, it was not depicted clearly, which data sets were used for computing table $2$. We used the folders in the folder "Dev Set" of the folder "CoE dataSet". 

$10$-fold cross validation leads to small test sizes applied to $95$ data points. This is the size of the training data. Still, we imitated this approach. 

The movie names in the different files were written slightly variably (apostrophes appeared for example in some files, in others not). It was extra work to merge this data.
