This report marks our attempt to recreate the results from the \textbf{TUD-MMC at MediaEval 2016: Context of Experience}\cite{Wang2016} paper. In the efforts to obtain results as similar as possible, we focus on the experimental design and reproducability of the template. Whenever the processing steps are not clearly defined we try to apply an approach that is reasonable in respect to the situation.
