      " 'Thrilling and superbly acted, The Hunger Games captures the dramatic violence, raw emotion, and ambitious scope of its source novel.'\n",
      " \"Smart, smoothly directed, and enriched with a deeper exploration of the franchise's thought-provoking themes, Catching Fire proves a thoroughly compelling second installment in the Hunger Games series.\"\n",
      " \"With an outstanding starring performance from Benedict Cumberbatch illuminating its fact-based story, The Imitation Game serves as an eminently well-made entry in the 'prestige biopic' genre.\"\n",
      " 'Solidly cast and beautifully filmed but thoroughly cliched, The Judge seems destined to preside over a large jurisdiction of the basic cable afternoon-viewing circuit.'\n",
      " 'Neither intelligent enough to work as thought-provoking sci-fi nor trashy enough to provide B-movie thrills, The Last Days on Mars proves as cinematically barren as the titular planet.'\n",
      " 'Harmless piece of fluff that ought to satisfy fans of the TV show.'\n",
      " \"Thanks to the Wachowskis' imaginative vision, The Matrix is a smartly crafted combination of spectacular action and groundbreaking special effects.\"\n",
      " 'With strong acting, a solid premise, and a refreshingly dark approach to its dystopian setting, The Maze Runner stands out from the crowded field of YA sci-fi adventures.'\n",
      " 'Thanks to Emmy-worthy performances from a reputable cast, The Normal Heart is not only a powerful, heartbreaking drama, but also a vital document of events leading up to and through the early AIDS crisis.'\n",
      " 'Writer-director Nancy Meyers takes the winning formula of the 1961 original and gives it an amiable modern spin, while young star Lindsay Lohan shines in her breakout role.'\n",
      " \"Despite Kate Winslet's superb portrayal, The Reader suggests an emotionally distant, Oscar-baiting historical drama.\"\n",
      " \"Part biopic, part love story, The Theory of Everything rises on James Marsh's polished direction and the strength of its two leads.\"\n",
      " \"This Is Where I Leave You has its moments, but given the amount of talent assembled onscreen, the rather pedestrian results can't help but feel like a letdown.\"\n",
      " \"Under Paul Verhoeven's frenetic direction, Total Recall is a fast-paced rush of violence, gore, and humor that never slacks.\"\n",
      " \"With the fourth installment in Michael Bay's blockbuster Transformers franchise, nothing is in disguise: Fans of loud, effects-driven action will find satisfaction, and all others need not apply.\"\n",
      " \"Visually stunning and thought-provoking, V For Vendetta's political pronouncements may rile some, but its story and impressive set pieces will nevertheless entertain.\"\n",
      " 'A transfixing central performance by Kristen Wiig performance holds Welcome to Me together and compensates for its uneven stretches.'\n",
      " 'Wickedly hilarious and delightfully deranged, Wild Tales is a subversive satire that doubles as a uniformly entertaining anthology film.'\n",
      " \"While both talented performers in their own right, Juliette Binoche and Clive Owen are decidedly mismatched in Words and Pictures, and they aren't done many favors by the movie's awkwardly constructed screenplay.\"]\n",
